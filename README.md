### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Pierrick

I am a software developer, mainly in __Java (Spring, ...) / Angular 2+__

After few years experiencing software development, I decided to dig deeper in that field.

This GitHub profile is where I will try to spend most of my free time :

- :truck: building side projects
- :hammer_and_wrench: breaking/fixing these side projects
- :star2:	experiencing modern technologies, best coding practices

Stay tuned !

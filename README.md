### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Pierrick

I am a solution architect / previous software developer, mainly in __Java (Spring, ...) / Angular__

After few years fumbling around software development, I decided to dig deeper in that field.

This GitHub workspace is where I will try to spend most of my free time :

- :truck: building side projects
- :hammer_and_wrench: breaking/fixing these side projects
- :star2:	experiencing modern technologies, best coding practices

Stay tuned !
